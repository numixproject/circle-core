For Fedora, Red Hat and OpenSUSE, we have setup repos on [OpenSUSE build service](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:paolorotolo:numix).

Alternatively, if you are on Fedora, install [Fedy](http://satya164.github.io/fedy/) and run the following command in a terminal:

For Arch users there's a [community maintained package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/numix-circle-icon-theme-git/) in the AUR which builds from this GitHub.

### Icon Requests
For normal applications follow [this video tutorial](https://plus.google.com/+NumixprojectOrg/posts/DkRmhFZuWez), for Steam games follow [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuUy4CzCoXc) and for Chrome apps just post a link to the webstore page. When filing your request please be respectful, patient, and remember that Circle development is done solely on the back of donations.

### Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/wiki/App-Support).
